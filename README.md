Hey there,

I am Oguz Ziya Koseomur, currently Master's student in Technical University Munich, Computational Science and Engineering program. However, you can call me someone who is stuck in between **computer science** and **mechanical engineering** :shipit:

I mainly work in the field of:
- **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD):** Turbulence modeling, combustion, solver development and algorithms
- **Numerical methods for PDEs:** finite element, finite volume methods
- **Scientific computing:** Linear solvers, discretization, parallel computing

And I am also interested in Deep Learning, especially its applications in the data-driven modeling and differentiable solvers.

My work generally consists of following languages and tools:
- C++, Python and MATLAB
- MPI and OpenMP

Currently I am a developer at [preCICE](https://www.precice.org), a coupling library for multi-physics simulations. If you are interested, do not forget to visit [the repository of preCICE](https://github.com/precice)
